This is a machine learning algorithm that functions as a binary classifier. It is based on a single processing unit called a perceptron, which takes a set of inputs and produces a binary output. The perceptron applies weights to each input and sums them along with a threshold to determine the final output. <p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/JavierAM01/Perceptron-Simple">See details</a></p> |
